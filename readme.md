## Project description

Our MVP includes the ability to rotate the Land Rover by 90 degrees to the left or right, move it forward by one grid, and display its position on a grid in the terminal, with input values fed into unit tests.

We assume that the plateau is a square or rectangular grid.

In the future, we plan to support different shaped plateaus, allow input via a console application, and enable input via a file.

The project is developed using Java, JUnit 5, and Maven.

## Installation

Please ensure that you have Java and Maven installed on your computer. To run the unit tests, use the command 'mvn test'.
